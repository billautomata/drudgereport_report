# fair use

I understand the domain name for this data journalism tool is very close to the original [drudgereport.com](http://drudgereport.com) domain.

I am claiming [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) on the re-use of the drudgereport trademark.

I am not doing this for profit, it is a public service for media research.

Please do not sue me.  I'm going to forward any cease and desist letters to EFF/ACLU lawyers I know.
